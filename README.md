<h2>About This Website Project</h2>
_______________________________________

<h4> 
This Project is about making a website where you can buy things though the website/ a web shop.
I tried to make it as modeler as possible though my action by making it easy to add product in website
and adding easy to navigate.

This Project was the first big springboot app I have build but the assignment was from 22 March-20 April.

<h2>Processes Making WebShop</h2>
__________________________________________
<h4> 
While making this project I had to search upp information about Html, thymeleaf, SpringBoot and Jpa.
It was not that hard to find the information if you knew what you looked for, but sometimes I had problems thinking about what could be the problem.

When Person comes to the first page they are greeted by wit login page where you first need to sign in to the website before starting your shopping.
If you don't have an account you can always register as a user or an admin. Admin will not be able to buy product they are just able to deliver product or add products to the database.

I am using MySql for database and using Jpa to save products to database.
